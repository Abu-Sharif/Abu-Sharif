## Project: Conway’s Game of Life – Image-Based Cellular Automata Art  

Creative exploration of **cellular automata**, where each pixel in an image evolves over time following **Conway’s Game of Life** rules.  
The project blends computation and art — transforming static BMP images into dynamic, color-evolving patterns through algorithmic simulation, built with Pyhon & Pygame.
